Project Description:
<br>
             An event management system for college groups using face recognition to identify users and let them easily sign up for events and then notify them about status via email with the system generated QR Code , and to easily show organizers the data they have access to and to let them manage it, so that we can focus more on the event itself, instead of wondering about handling the registrations.
